# ReForm.re todo app example.

### Running it:
To get this up and running simply clone this repo into your machine and run the following commands:
- `yarn reason:start` to get `bucklescript` to run on watch mode.
- `yarn webpack:server` to get `webpack-dev-server` up and running.

### Need help?
Feel free to shoot me or any of the ReForm guys a message.
